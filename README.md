# Semaphore
1. Question 1 of OSTEP Chapter 31. Here is the skeleton code fork-join.c. Refer to Fig. 31.6.
2. (Rendezvous) Question 2 of OSTEP Chapter 31. Here is the skeleton code rendezvous.c.
3. (Partial Order) The pthread program order.c creates four threads, p1, p2, p3, and p4. By using the
minimum number of semaphores, annotate the program with semaphore declarations (of type sem t)
and calls, sem init(), sem wait(), and sem post(), so that no matter which order these four
threads are created, the program produces either of the following outputs.
